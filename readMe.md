# Class Assignment 5: Arrays Practice!
**Step 1:** 
Write the following into a single array.

let vegetable1 = "broccoli";
let vegetable2 = "carrots";
let vegetable3 = "celery"; 

**Step 2:**  
Add an additional vegetable to the `vegetables` variable.

**Step 3:** 
Can you make the vegetable you added appear first in the list?

**Step 4:**

- Task 1: Update the variable `songList` so that it is an array with at least 3 song titles.
- Task 2: Update the variable `classList` so that it is an array with 4 students (including yourself) in your class.
- Task 3: Update the variable `teacherList` so that it is an array with all the adults in your class.
- Task 4: Update the variable `familyAges` so that it is an array with a list of ages (numbers) of your family members.

**Step 5:**


- Task 5: Update the variable `favSong` to retrieve the array element of your favorite song in the songList array (Task 1). 
- Task 6: Update the variable `bestStudent` to retrieve your name from the classList array (Task 2).
- Task 7: Update the variable `tallestTeacher` to retrieve the array element of the tallest teacher in the teacherList array (Task 3).
- Task 8: Update the variable `oldestMember` to retrieve the array element of the oldest member of your family in the familyAges array. (Task 4)

### Finished early?
- Create an array that combines both the class list and the teacher list without rewriting the names of students and teachers.
- Google how to combine arrays you've already created.
